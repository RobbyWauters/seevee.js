# ROADMAP


## Features for Release 1


### Math

* Matrix Math Class
* Sparse Mtrix Class
* Vector Math Class
* Point Class (2d)
* Point3d Class
* Scalar Class
* Rect Class
* Range Class

* Transformation Class (perhaps whole section)

### Data Classes

* LocalStorage Class
* JSON Class
* XML Class
* WebSQL Class

### Machine Learning

* Statistical Class
* Normal Bayes Class
* Nearest Neighbours Class
* Support Vector Macines Class
* Decision Trees Class
* Random Trees Class
* Boosting Class
* Expectation Maximization Class
* Neural Networks Class

### WebGL
WebGL features should be optional, it's still potentially possible that Microsoft will never enable WebGL in Internet Explorer and as such the whole library should run without it. WebGL should certainly be used to speed up operations if the capability is detected.


### Misc Core features

* Internal Error Class
* Custom Error Class
* System (capability) Class
* Dependency Loader / Bootstrapper
* Events Class (extendable)
* Stats Class

### Input

* Device Class
* Loader Class 
* Data Class
* Stream Class (perhaps crossover with stream class) 



### Output

* Canvas Class
* Buffer Class (double buffering offscreen) -- perhaps this shouldn't be in this grouping
* Video Encoding Class
* Audio Encoding Class
* Image Encoding Class


### Image Processing

* Pass Class (prep for node based compositing)
* Image Class
* Pointer Class (for byte arrays etc)
* Image Filter Class base to extend upon
* Gaussian Blur Class
* Median Blur Class
* Sobel Class
* Bilateral Class
* Levels Class
* Histogram Class
* Sharpen Class
* HSL Class
* Desaturate Class
* Erode Class
* Dilate Class
* Contours Class
* Gamma Class
* Gain Class


### Video Processing

* Video Class
* Stream Class


### Audio Processing

Im not versed enoughin audio for this...

### Spatial Analysis

* Space2D Class
* Space3D Class
.... more to come here, or perhaps burst out to more of an augmented reality class grouping...


### Object Detection

* Template Class
* Cascade Class
* Descriptor Class
* Feature Detection Class
* Search Class



## Documentation

General class documentation needed


## Demos & Examples

Some simple 'getting started' style tutorials, then a few mixing in with other libraries jQuery etc, then perhaps a few advanced ons based on feature tracking and augmented reality as this tends to be impressive.
