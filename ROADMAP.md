.... more to come here, or perhaps burst out to more of an augmented reality class grouping...


### Object Detection

* Template Class
* Cascade Class
* Descriptor Class
* Feature Detection Class
* Search Class



## Documentation

General class documentation needed


## Demos & Examples

Some simple 'getting started' style tutorials, then a few mixing in with other libraries jQuery etc, then perhaps a few advanced ons based on feature tracking and augmented reality as this tends to be impressive.
